Hi, I'm an undergraduate student at Peking University, [School of Electronics Engineering and Computer Science (EECS)](http://eecs.pku.edu.cn/Home/HOME.htm) and [Center of Frontiers of Computing Studies](http://cfcs.pku.edu.cn). I'm a student of professor Deng Xiaotie, work in daGAME laboratory. My research interests are theoretical computer science and its applications in economics, such like fair divisions, auction design, and machine learning applications. I have 2 publications in progress，and some ongoing research projects.

My email is shizhuming at pku.edu.cn

Research experience
======

June 2022 -- Present Summer Research Intern
------
Mentors: Yang Cai (Yale University).

We focus on lower bounds of regret in No-regret learning algorithms in self-play games. Our perpose is to achieve a near optimal lower bound of no-regret learning in games, for example, $O(1)$ lower bound. Numerical experiments are employed in our research. This research is still in process.


October 2021 - October 2022 Undergraduate Research
------
Mentors: Xiaotie Deng (Peking University).

Throttling is one of the most popular budget control methods in today's online advertising markets. When a budget-constrained advertiser employs throttling, she can choose whether or not to participate in an auction after the advertising platform recommends a bid. This paper focuses on the dynamic budget throttling process in repeated second-price auctions from a theoretical view. Different information structures, whether or not the bidder can access the highest competing bid, were also taken into consideration. We propose the OGD-CB algorithm, which involves simultaneous distribution learning and revenue optimization. In both settings, we demonstrate that this algorithm guarantees an $O(\sqrt{T\log T})$ regret with probability $1−O(1/T)$ relative to the fluid adaptive throttling benchmark.

October 2020 - May 2021 Challenge Cup 2021
------
Mentors: Ming Zhang (Peking University).

We use an artificial neural network to predict old people's weakness in two years with biochemical indicators. And then we construct a website to make the model accessible to the world. The source code will be open source when this project finished.

October 2019 - May 2020 Challenge Cup 2020
------
Mentors: Jiaying Liu (Peking University).

An artificial neural network was imployed in our work to map the IIM data to the distribution of the six major oxides on the moon. Finally we got new maps of lunar surface chemistry. The source code is open source on [https://github.com/ShiZhuming/ChallengeCup](https://github.com/ShiZhuming/ChallengeCup)
