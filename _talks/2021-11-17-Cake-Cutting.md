This is a paper reading in WINE 2021 Reading Group. This paper focuses on envy-free division of multi-layered cakes. In this paper, authors define multi-layered cakes, which means cakes with multi layers, and the feasibility constraint in cake-cutting : the pieces of different layers assigned to the same agent should be non-overlapping. Then, authors define short knives and long knives. Finally, authors propose an envy-free division using $n-1$ long knives.
