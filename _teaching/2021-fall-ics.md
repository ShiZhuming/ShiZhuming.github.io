This course is for computer scientists, computer engineers, and others who want to be able to write better programs by learning what is going on “under the hood” of a computer system. Our aim is to explain the enduring concepts underlying all computer systems, and to show you the concrete ways that these ideas affect the correctness, performance, and utility of your application programs. Other systems books are written from a builder’s perspective, describing how to implement the hardware or the systems software, including the operating system, compiler, and network interface. This course is taught from a programmer’s perspective, describing how application programmers can use their knowledge of a system to write better programs. Of course, learning what a system is supposed to do provides a good first step in learning how to build one, and so this book also serves as a valuable introduction to those who go on to implement systems hardware and software.
